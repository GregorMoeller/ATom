# ATom
Matlab software package for atmospheric tomography processing

Author: Gregor Moeller (gregor.moeller@tuwien.ac.at)

ATom is a MATLAB GUI based software package, which has been developed within the GNSS-ATom project (840098) - financed by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) in the years 2013 to 2015.

‘ATom’ stands for Atmospheric Tomography, the core part of the ATom software package. In addition, ATom allows for conversion of:

- broadcast ephemerides into ECEF satellite positions, elevation or azimuth angles
- zenith total delays into zenith wet delays or slant delays 
- numerical weather model data into refractivity fields
- refractivity fields into zenith delays
- slant delays into total or wet refractivity fields

Therefore, common formats like Napeos, Bernese, IGS SINEX Tropo or the ‘new’ SINEX Tropo format, navigation messages for GPS and GLONASS as well as several formats for post-fit residuals and in-situ measurements are supported.
